# What is Conference Buddy?

Do you feel uncomfortable or anxious in social situations, especially when you don't know anyone? Well, a lot of us do and big events can be a real challenge. That’s were Conference Buddy comes in! It provides a buddy system to help people feel more welcome and comfortable at tech events. Conference Buddy is also for all the wonderful folks out there who want to offer that kind of support!

## What matters most

We want to help people to feel more included and welcome in our community. We all have to feel safe to do so! 

This event provides a Code of Conduct. While following this code is important anyway, you as Conference Buddy should be extra aware of it. If you ever feel uncomfortable or unsafe, don't hesitate to reach out to someone from the [Code of Conduct team](https://devopsdays.org/events/2024-amsterdam/conduct).

We are here to support you!

## How does it work?

* Grab one of our badges. Wear it visibly on your lanyard or clothes! This lets others know that you are approachable and supportive.
* Approach people with Conference Buddy badges. (If you are comfortable with it!) Maybe you are the person to make them feel welcome. Or vice versa!
* Post on social media. Let others know that you are looking for a `#ConfBuddy`. Use the hashtag of the conference (`#devopsdays`) or tag it, too.
* Follow the Pacman rule. When standing as a group of people, always leave room for others to join your group. This sends a visual signal of: “Hey, you are welcome here!”. 
* Come to the Conference Buddy booth and hang out with us!
