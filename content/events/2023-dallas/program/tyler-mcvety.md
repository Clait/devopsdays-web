##### TALK ABSTRACT

Those of us that attend DevOpsDays have a particular mindset: To Get new Ideas on how to better the organizations we work for and our careers. However, often times, we are met with resistance for a number of reasons, for automation in particular this could be not trusting automation, fear of being able to maintain code, or even the classic “We don’t have time”. We will discuss how to bring more individuals to your side to influence your organization, and enable those that are willing to develop processes, procedures, and importantly, automation on their own. While we will be focusing on automation in particular, the core skills discussed can be used to help shape the direction and decisions of your team/org.
